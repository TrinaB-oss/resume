      <div class="ABOUT">
    <p>I started the IndigiTECH Program through the Indigenous Friends Association and received two certifications as of October 2022. The first certification is for Intro to Web Development and the second is Intro to Front-End with JavaScript. In addition, I am also getting certified in: UX Design, Digital Art, Indigenous Technologies and Leadership & Governance. As a new graduate from the IndigiTECH Mentorship Program, my recent Front End Development project led to the creation of a website for an up-and-coming Indigenous music producer/artist.</p>
      <p>The website will bring him new clientele, allow him to announce live shows, display new videos and beats and increase his exposure. In UX design, I worked as part of an interdisciplinary team to create a website similar to change.org. The purpose behind this was to showcase our ability to recreate a land and water app that could allow people to donate, blog and find more information regarding this matter.</p>

		<p> In addition to my technical skills, I am also adept in business management. I completed my certification in Business Management through UBC, Sauder School of Business. In 2000, I completed my Office Administration Certificate, Business Administration and my grade 12 from Kwantlen Polytechnic University. In addition, I also volunteered at a nonprofit society as President for 1.5 years.</p>
